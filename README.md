# E-commerce-project

## Description
For this project I was tasked wiht building upon starter code for a e-commerce site. I was asked to create the backend routes and connect all of the routes to the database and ensure that everything functions well. I was then asked to show how to run the database and display the table in terminal, as well as test all of my routes in insomnia.


## Installation
To intall this project I first needed to make sure all of the dependencies were downloaded. From there when it was time to start the server and begin testing, I ran the seeds file and then used node server to start the server. In order to show the database and table i needed to use mysql with the command mysql -u root -p. From there i used show datebases to display the tables. In order to test the routes I used insomnia and tested GET POST PUT and DELETE.


## Usage
In order to run my code you can follow the same steps listed above in installation


## User Story
